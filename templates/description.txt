 Shadow Monsters is the experience of the summer at the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston. Strike a pose, and watch your shadows become larger-than-life creatures, projected onto the wmassive walls of the Museum's Cullinan Hall. The monsters grow teeth and claws and they even roar and growl! This immersive digital art experience which comes alive when particpants creat their own shadow plays and their silhouettes are recast in these fantastic forms, was created by New York-based British artist Philip Worthington
